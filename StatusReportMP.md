# Status Report - Maclain Prom

# Progress

For this milestone, I focused primarily on Week 3 and Week 4 tasks, which involved full data collection, cleaning, and merging. I developed improvements to the API function including retry logic and exponential backoff to handle rate limiting. I also helped standardize the datasets, resolve duplicates, and run validation checks on the integrated results. 

Throughout the weeks, Diego and I worked together on ideas, code testing, and documenting each step in the curation log. 

In the upcoming weeks, we will both work on exploratory data analysis and build regional comparisons and more visualizations. I will also support all of the testing and help refine the final presentation and report so the results are clearly communicated.
