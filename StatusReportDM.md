For this milestone, I helped lead the setup and early stages of the project. I was mainly responsible for Week 1 and Week 2 tasks, including exploring the SimpleMaps dataset, confirming the fields we needed, and testing the Google Air Quality API with different cities to ensure the request flow worked properly. I also created the initial folder structure and helped define a consistent schema for integration across datasets. 

Throughout all tasks, I collaborated with Maclain to make decisions and ensure we were both on the same page. In the coming weeks, I will focus more on statistical analysis, correlation tests, and visualization work in Week 5 and Week 6. I will also support Maclain with whatever he needs and help maintain documentation so the final workflow is clear.
